We would like to thank the ITU for informing us about the new work item
QSTR.MVC "Method for Verifying Conformance to SRv6" [1]. Specifically, we appreciate
that the ITU is soliciting feedback for a work related to an IETF-developed
technology: Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6). We acknoweldge that the technical report
does not alter any SRv6 specification or seek to specify new SRv6 requirements outside of IETF's work.

The specifications listed as "Core SRv6 Standards" in the attached document to
the LS reflect a subset of SRv6-related Proposed Standards published so far by the IETF.
These RFCs were produced by several Working Groups (WGs), mainly SPRING, 6MAN, and OPSAWG.
The full list of published RFCs can be retrieved from [2].

Unlike what is stated in the report, some of the listed RFCs (e.g., RFC 8665, 8666, and 8667) do not
apply with an IPv6 data plane. Also, the correct names for these RFCs is as follows:

   * RFC 8666: OSPF Extensions for Segment Routing
   * RFC 8665: OSPFv3 Extensions for Segment Routing
   * RFC 8665: IS-IS Extensions for Segment Routing

Note that some other SRv6-related specification are being finalized by SPRING, in particular.
Notably, "Compressed SRv6 Segment List Encoding (CSID)" [3] is planned for
publication by the IETF in the coming few months.

While ensuring better interoperability is one of the key objectives of the IETF
specifications, the IETF does not produce formal conformance test suites per se. However, the IETF
has a Working Group (WG) that is chartered for Benchmarking Methodology (BMWG WG) [4].

For information, the BMWG is actively working on an SR-related benchmarking
methodology specification [5] with a focus on performance for both SRv6 and SR-MPLS.
This specification is planned for publication by the end of 2025.
 
For future collaboration on these matters, we encourage the use of BMWG WG mailing list [6]
as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information, answering questions,
and progressing any work.
