We would like to thank the ITU for informing us about the new work item
QSTR.MVC "Method for Verifying Conformance to SRv6" [1]. Specifically, we appreciate
that the ITU is soliciting feedback for a work related to an IETF-developed
technology: Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6). We acknoweldge that the technical report
does not seek to alter or specify new SRv6 new requirements outside of IETF’s work.

We confirm that the specifications listed as "Core SRv6 Standards" in
the attached document to the LS reflect all SRv6-related Proposed Standards
published so far by the IETF. These RFCs were produced by several Working Groups (WGs),
mainly SPRING, 6MAN, and OPSAWG.

While ensuring better interoperability is one of the key objectives of the IETF
specifications, the IETF does not produce formal conformance test suites per se. However, the IETF
has a Working Group (WG) that is chartered for Benchmarking Methodology (BMWG WG) [2].

For information, the BMWG is actively working on an SR-related benchmarking
methodology specification [3] with a focus on performance for both SRv6 and SR-MPLS.
This specification is planned for publication by the end of 2025.
 
For future collaboration on these matters, we encourage the use of BMWG WG mailing list [4]
as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information, answering questions,
and progressing any work.
