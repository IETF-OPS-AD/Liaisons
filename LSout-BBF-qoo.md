The IETF IPPM WG [1] would like to inform the BBF about the progress of "Quality of Outcome" [2], an Informational document that is about to be placed in the IETF Last Call. This document leverages "Quality Attenuation"
defined in the BBF (TR-452.1).

The IPPM WG would like to request BBF to review the document and provide comments about the document.

The IPPM WG also encourages the use of IPPM WG mailing list [3] as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information, answering questions, and progressing any work.

OPS Area Director: Mohamed Boucadair

IPPM Chairs: Marcus Ihlar & Thomas Graf
