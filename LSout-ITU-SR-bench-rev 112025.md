As a follow-up to the LS [1] sent back in 07/2025, the IETF BMWG WG [2] would like to inform the ITU-T SG11 about the progress of "Benchmarking Methodology for Segment Routing" [3]. This Informational document
is about to be placed in the WG Last Call. This document may be relevant to the ITU-T SG11 work on "Method for Verifying Conformance to SRv6" effort.

The BMWG WG would like to request ITU-T SG to review the document and provide comments.

Also, the BMWG WG encourages the use of IPPM WG mailing list [4] as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information and answering questions.

OPS Area Director: Mohamed Boucadair

IPPM Chairs: Giuseppe Fioccola & Sarah Banks
