We would like to thank the ITU-T SG11 for this update on the "Method for Verifying Conformance to SRv6" effort [1] and for sharing the plan to address the comments included in our previous reply [2].
 
As indicated in [2], we encourage the use of Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) mailing list [3] as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information,
answering questions, and progressing any work for future collaboration on these matters.

We appreciate that the ITU-T SG11 encourage experts, who have questions pertaining to SR benchmarking methodology, to address them to the BMWG WG.
Requests for presentations to share issues or present your work update can be sent to the BMWG Chairs [4].

We look forward to participation from the ITU on the BMWG WG mailing list and meetings from those in ITU interested in the work being done by the WG.
