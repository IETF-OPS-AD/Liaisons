The IETF IPPM WG [1] would like to inform the ITU-T SG12 about the progress of "Quality of Outcome" [2], a document that is about to be placed in the IETF Last Call for publication as Informational RFC
in the coming months. The document does not define a Standard or includes deployment recommendations. More deployment experience is required prior to considering use of normative language
and make recommendations. Note also that this document leverages "Quality Attenuation" defined in the Broadband Forum (TR-452.1).

The IPPM WG would like to inform ITU-T SG12 about this work.

The IPPM WG encourages the use of IPPM WG mailing list [3] as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information, answering questions, and progressing any work.

OPS Area Director: Mohamed Boucadair

IPPM Chairs: Marcus Ihlar & Thomas Graf
